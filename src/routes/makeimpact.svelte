		<h2>Where we started</h2>
		<p>
			So when I first started at make!impact, there already was an app. The app had most of the
			functionalities it has today, but it really missed some of the "make!mpact vibe". The app was
			very black on white, and without much to treat the users. So the first part of this task was
			to start prototpying, and comming up with new design ideas. ðŸ¤”

		<h2>Keeping track</h2>
		<p>
			Working with an investment app, there is a lot of different screens and functionalities to
			keep track with. ðŸ˜… Everything has to be connected somehow, and most importantly of all, it
			HAS to make sense for even the most unexperienced user. In this app we also have a lot of
			inofrmation on how the companies are performing when it comes to sustainablity and social
			impact. All this data had to somehow be condensed and understanbale in the app.

			<h2>The make!mpact app</h2>
			<p>
				After a lot of protoyping and feedback sessions, we ended up with a slick new look app for
				make!mpact. The design and the app itself caters to young people, who wants to get into
				investing, and most importantly wants to do sustainable innvestments. <br />
				The black and pink look gives the app a more fresh and interesting vibe, compared to most conventional
				investing apps, which are often just black and white and filled with a lot of heavy data as soon
				as you open the app. Have a look at the protoype and see how you feel about the app. ðŸ˜Š
