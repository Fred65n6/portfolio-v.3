		<h2>Designing a logo</h2>
		<p>
			So we a have cool caf√©, we have a great product... what are we missing? a logo! One of the
			first thing I did while working with Toast no.9 was designing a logo which would also set the
			tone for the upcomming webdesign. The owner of Toast no.9 told us that he loves everything
			nineties! And what was huge thing in the nineties? MTV! So inspired by the MTV logo, I came up
			with this logo design for toast no.9. ‚úèÔ∏è

		<h2>Showing the product <br /> in a new way</h2>
		<p>
			Like the owner of the caf√©, we wanted to do things a little different with this one. So i
			started making these drawings of all the different sandwiches that Toast no.9 has to offer.
			The owner of the caf√© really loved this playfull way, to display his product. ‚ù§Ô∏è

			<h2>Bringing the caf√© to life</h2>
			<p>
				Inspired by what we already did with the drawings of the toasts, we wanted the webdesign to
				include all the different artifacts, that makes this caf√©s vibe so special. So I also
				sketched all the different things around the caf√©, and took them in to adobe Illustrator. üìª <br
