		<h2>Visual identity</h2>
		<p>
			Working with N√∏rrebro Bryghus, means working with a successfull company which already has a
			very defined visual identity. So when working with their website, one of the first think we
			thought we could do, was to incorporate this idenity even more in the webdesign, in order to
			make a bigger coherence between the brand and their website. That's why we chose to take the
			flowers from their bottle labels, and make them a main feature of the website. üå∏

		<h2>Information architecture</h2>
		<p>
			N√∏rrebro bryghus' website has a lot of pages, like a lot, and through user surveys, we could
			conclude that the users found it difficult to navigate the website. That's why one of our
			biggest tasks, working with this website, was the information architecture, and trying to
			rearrange the navigation, and the way the website was set up. ‚úçÔ∏è

			<h2>Product display</h2>
			<p>
				To finish of this website and the webshop that we build, we wanted to display the products
				(meaning the beers üçª) really nice. We weren't able to find good picture material for this.
				So that's why i created these mock-ups in photoshop, which could show the simple but very
				beautiful label design of labels. <br />
				In the end we were really satisfied with the website we managed to create for N√∏rrebro bryghus.
