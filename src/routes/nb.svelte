		<h2>Visual identity</h2>
		<p>
			Working with N√∏rrebro Bryghus, means working with a successfull company which already has a
			very defined visual identity. So when working with their website, one of the first think we
			thought we could do, was to incorporate their idenity even more in the webdesign, in order to
			make a bigger coherence between the brand and their website. That's why we chose to take the
			flower design from their bottle labels, and make them a main feature on the website. üå∏

		<h2>Information architecture</h2>
		<p>
			N√∏rrebro bryghus' website has a lot of pages... like a lot, and through user surveys, we could
			conclude that the users found it difficult to navigate the website. That's why one of our
			biggest tasks, working with this website, was creating a better information architecture, by
			rearranging the navigation, and the way the website was set up. ‚úçÔ∏è

			<h2>Product display</h2>
			<p>
				To finish of this website and the webshop that we build, we wanted to display the products
				(meaning the beers üçª) in a really nice way but we weren't able to find good picture
				material for this. So that's why I created these mock-ups in photoshop, which could show the
				simple but very beautiful label designs. <br />
				In the end we were really satisfied with the website we managed to create for N√∏rrebro bryghus.
